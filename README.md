# Bryan Curtis - Code Sample


## How I solved the problem and tested the solution:


### I used the files in the project folder [SOURCE_FILES] as text versions of Foley website content pages.
### 	*	Foley-About-Us.txt
### 	*	Foley-Website-Disclaimer.txt
### I used a Visual Studio template for an MVC web app with .NET Core 5
### 		*	I started with a basic file upload (See project folder 'upload').
### 		*	Files in the [upload] folder are listed on the home page
### 		*	I added links/methods to download the files or view the concordance results (on a separate view/page)
### 		*	I added a list to take advantage of the sort method and placeholder arrays to represent columns for word-count and sentence listings
### 		*	I revised to eliminate control characters and space issues in the source files with some string replacements/regex
### 		* 	I left the non-word entries in the results but added a CSS class to render those records differently on hover in the results list.
### ------------------------------------------------------------------------		
### *I could spend a great deal of time on this but it meets the basic requirements for now.*
